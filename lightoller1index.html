                Charles Herbert Lightoller was a prominent officer of the White Star Line in the early 1900s. He sailed on the Titanic on her fatal maiden voyage in April 1912, serving as second officer. He was the senior-most officer to survive the sinking.            <p>
            <p>
                When viewed in contrast with other prominent officers of the White Star Line during that time, Lightoller’s disposition embodies something which we might now call “chaotic energy,” having nearly lost his job over a prank involving a cannon in Australia in 1901, and being chastised by the captain of the Oceanic in 1910 for immature conduct (Lightoller was, at the time, the first officer of that ship). On the Titanic, Lightoller is probably most commonly viewed in contrast to the first officer, William McMaster Murdoch, who stuck strictly to business, and was renowned by all his colleagues for his capability, if viwed as a little bit detached emotionally while on the job.            <p>
             <p> The question bears asking as to whether the rampant discussions of Lightoller’s religious beliefs within Titanic discourse stem from this view of Lightoller as an eccentric character.
                Lightoller was a self-professed Christian Scientist, having penned multiple articles for Christian Science journals. It seems doubtful that such interest would have been paid to Lightoller were he an Anglican or a Protestant.
